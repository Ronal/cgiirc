TODO
----

bugs:
- problems with the smilie regexps
- horzontal scrolling with really long lines
- messages appearing in status rather than query
- ctcp kill format.
- remove ban code.
- ctrl+c in main frame
- altgr

features:
- form_redirect optional.
- adding code to check for op to add op/voice/deop/devoice/ban/kick to userlist
- scrolling locks if the window is scrolled upwards
- pop-out needs to work in mozilla too
  mozilla seems to be being typically braindead about this
- topic bar
  this is going to be difficult as it comes along with wanting to reposition
  the tab bar as well, i'm not sure of the best way of doing this (and
  interfaces are already too messy).
- 0.4 had a status bar in text-* themes, make shownick into something better?
- who list format
- formats could be made more user friendly, allow selection of them on login
  form?
- icons in userlist for 005 prefix.
- format selection
- right click context menus
- admin interface?

docs:
- admin password

Sucky bits of code need rewriting:
- The whole interface thing
- Options
- Formats could be in their own module
- More use of handlers/events.
- IPv6 handling, most stuff should work with IPv6, but some is messy :(
