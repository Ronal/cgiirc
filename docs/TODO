TODO
----

bugs:
- ; in smilies

--- Release 0.5 here.

- pop-out needs to work in mozilla too
  mozilla seems to be being typically braindead about this
- topic bar
  this is going to be difficult as it comes along with wanting to reposition
  the tab bar as well, i'm not sure of the best way of doing this (and
  interfaces are already too messy).

Might be done one day:
- right click context menus

Sucky bits of code need rewriting:
- The whole interface thing
- Options
- Formats could be in their own module
- More use of handlers/events.
- IPv6 handling, most stuff should work with IPv6, but some is messy :(
