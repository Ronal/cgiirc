KEY:

IRC Module:
= RawCommand stuff: each handler needs to be more consistant
= formats
= sort out targets
= activity levels
- ctcp (userinfo, version, ping)
- use 005 numeric if possible (mode can use PREFIX and CHANMODES)
:www.polarhome.com 005 a SAFELIST SILENCE KNOCK IRCOPS WATCH=128 MODES=6 MAXCHANNELS=10 MAXBANS=60 MAXEXEMPTS=60 NICKLEN=30 TOPICLEN=307 CHANTYPES=#& CHANMODES=be,k,l,N PREFIX=(aohv)*@%+ NETWORK=BetaONE :are available on this server

Commands:
= pass params
- add commands
- default pass through
- access commands
- commands that will call to interface: help, (un)query

Interfaces:
Javascript Interface:
- userlist: need to sort mode changes
- right click context menus
- pop-out needs to work in mozilla too
- tab completeion in mozilla?
- key worded channels / nick in use text entry?
- better handling of stream disconnections (also config option to go to page)

NonJS Interface:
- do this :)
= auto detection of browser
- selecting colour in interfaces?

= default.pm holds login with @ISA

irc.cgi:
- how does login work with multiple channels and keys?
-? show browser button in advanced, with (automatic)


nph-irc.cgi:
- config fonts
- config timestamps
- config vhost
- change tmp file system
  directory prefix/rand/,  sock, ip, server, cookie
- random value via http referer problem
  cookie read on frameset load, if set write to ^^cookie file and check
  future requests

Abuse:
- multiple connects from the same IP
- ctcp kill/ban
- limiting the number of connections to a server? (^^^ sock/server)
- admin interface?
