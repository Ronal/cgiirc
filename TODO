TODO
----
KEY:
- TODO
= semi-done
+ done
? not sure
! important

IRC Module:
= RawCommand stuff: each handler needs to be more consistant
= formats
+ sort out targets
= activity levels
= ctcp (userinfo, version, ping)
- use 005 numeric if possible (mode can use PREFIX and CHANMODES)
:www.polarhome.com 005 a SAFELIST SILENCE KNOCK IRCOPS WATCH=128 MODES=6 MAXCHANNELS=10 MAXBANS=60 MAXEXEMPTS=60 NICKLEN=30 TOPICLEN=307 CHANTYPES=#& CHANMODES=be,k,l,N PREFIX=(aohv)*@%+ NETWORK=BetaONE :are available on this server

Commands:
+ pass params
= add commands
+ default pass through
+ access commands
- commands that will call to interface: help, (un)query
+ don't send blank lines
+ /nick doesn't work?
+ /part
+ quit seperate from version

Interfaces:
- hilight text targeted at nickname
Javascript Interface:
- make bottom typing frame more obvious (re: m-saunders' and chunky's comments)
- userlist: need to sort mode changes
- right click context menus
- pop-out needs to work in mozilla too
- tab completeion in mozilla?
- key worded channels / nick in use text entry?
- better handling of stream disconnections (also config option to go to page)
- channel part
- close windows
- quit in more than one channel

NonJS Interface:
- do this :)
= auto detection of browser
- selecting colour in interfaces?

= default.pm holds login with @ISA

irc.cgi:
- how does login work with multiple channels and keys?
-? show browser button in advanced, with (automatic)


nph-irc.cgi:
- config fonts
- config timestamps
- config vhost
= change tmp file system
  directory prefix/rand/,  sock, ip, server, cookie
- random value via http referer problem
  cookie read on frameset load, if set write to ^^cookie file and check
  future requests
- session timeout if no data sent (set optionally)

Abuse:
= multiple connects from the same IP (use ipaccess file for this)
- ctcp kill/ban
- limiting the number of connections to a server? (^^^ sock/server)
- admin interface?
